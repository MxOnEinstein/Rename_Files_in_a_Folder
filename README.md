# Rename_Files_in_a_Folder
This PowerShell script renames files in a specified folder by incrementing a numerical part of their names while preserving the original file extension. It is useful for renaming batches of files, such as photos, in sequential order.
Usage:

Specify the folder path where the files are located.
The script will rename files in the folder, keeping the original file format.
It ensures that only the numerical part of the filename is incremented.
Example: If you have files named "IMG001.jpg," "IMG002.jpg," and so on, running the script will rename them to "IMG004.jpg," "IMG005.jpg," and so forth.

Note: This script is helpful when you want to organize a large number of files by renaming them in a systematic manner.
